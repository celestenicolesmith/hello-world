# hello-world
I made a new GitHub account today for my Harvard CS50b class! 

This lesson is on Computational Thinking.

As a Product Owner, I had to become familiar with the team's GitHub practices and workflow, and review PRs before we committed them.

Hopefully, I'll be reviewing my own code sometime soon :)
